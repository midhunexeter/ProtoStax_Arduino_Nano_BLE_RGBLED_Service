using

* Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense 
 *
   [ProtoStax for Breadboard/Custom Boards](https://www.protostax.com/collections/all/products/protostax-for-breadboard)
   Enclosure to house and protect the Nano and other circuitry you
   might/can add
* A PC (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi) with Bluetooth support and Python

For further instructions, see the [Control Arduino Nano BLE's RGB LED with Bluetooth&Python
](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/sridhar-rajagopal/control-arduino-nano-ble-s-rgb-led-with-bluetooth-python-331e33)
Tutorial at [Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/sridhar-rajagopal/control-arduino-nano-ble-s-rgb-led-with-bluetooth-python-331e33)


## Prerequisites

Set up the Arduino Nano to use with your Arduino IDE - see [Getting started with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense)

Install ArduinoBLE Library using the Library Manager in your Arduino
IDE

On your PC, you will need
* Python 3
* install necessary python packages

```
pip3 install bleak
 
```


## Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/protostax/ProtoStax_Arduino_Nano_BLE_RGBLED_Service.git
```

or download from GitHub as a zip file and unzip it. 

## Usage

See additional instructions and details in Tutorial linked above 

```
cd ProtoStax_Arduino_Nano_BLE_RGBLED_Service
open
ProtoStax_Arduino_Nano_BLE_RGB_Peripheral/ProtoStax_Arduino_Nano_BLE_RGB_Peripheral.ino in
Arduino IDE
compile sketch and upload to your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
```

```
On your PC (Windows, Mac, Linux (including Raspberry Pi) with
Bluetooth support

cd ProtoStax_Arduino_Nano_BLE_RGBLED_Service
python3 rgbLED_Central.py
```
